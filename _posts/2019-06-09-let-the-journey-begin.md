I am very happy to be starting my first blog! I have always wanted to start a blog,
and it is finally happening!

My main objective here is to share all of my experiences as a Computer Science student,
as well as I plan on sharing all of my learning experiences with programming overall.

You may also follow me on Twitter for quick updates!

I hope you can all enjoy this content and... LET THE JOURNEY BEGIN!
