I am very happy to be starting my first blog!

<br>

I believe it will be an interesting experience
for both myself, and all of the readers.

<br>

My main objective here is to share all of my experiences as a Computer Science student,
as well as I plan on sharing all of my learning experiences with programming overall.

<br>

You may also follow me on Twitter for quick updates!

<br>

I hope you can all enjoy this content :)
